# chand-lab-rotation
A repo to store and share code produced while rotating in the [Chand Lab](http://sites.bu.edu/chandlab/) at BU.

We will create various schematics and simple demonstrations to generate figures for talks and for didactic purposes. We will also analyze a little bit of Chand's data using dimensionality reductions techniques.
